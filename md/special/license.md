The CSS and bit of frontend JavaScript are released to the public domain.

Showdown.js is released under the MIT License. I can't find the dev's name.

The Red Hat Display font has an obvious creator and is free under the SIL
International License.

The Monaco font is owned by Apple. I'll change fonts if asked to but otherwise
I hope y'all are cool with it. I did copy the file from my 2023 MBA if it helps
anything.

I am not affiliated with FromSoft, nor is this site licensed or endorsed by
them, and nothing here is meant to give that impression. I just really like
Elden Ring. And I could write a whole essay on why Ranni is better than Marika.
