The Monaco font is owned by Apple. I'll change fonts if asked to but otherwise
I hope y'all are cool with it. I did copy the file from my 2023 MBA if it helps
anything.

I don't know where the picture of Ranni in the corner came from. I can't find
the source with a reverse image search. If someone tells me who the artist is
I will credit them here.
