## Elden Cloud - Blocked Country
If you've been redirected to this page, you're visiting from a country believed
to be problematic. Either that, or geolocation has failed for one reason or
another. This block isn't meant to be discriminatory on the basis of anyone's
ethnicity, beliefs, or origin. It is simply an observable, unfortunate fact
that legitimate users from your country and others can come with a high ratio
of bad actors, be that spam, botting, propaganda, or illegal activities.

### Blocked Countries
- Israel
- India

This list is subject to growth.

### Israeli Visitors
If you're Israeli, there is a very high chance you support all of the
atrocities your government commits. Almost all of you support the forced
removal of Palestinians from their land, and nearly half of you support
outright killing them all, per a poll by Penn State University (that has been
*suspiciously* scrubbed from the internet). Also known as "ethnic cleansing"
and "genocide." Fuck off.
