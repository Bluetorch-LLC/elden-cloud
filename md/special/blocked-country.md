## Elden Cloud - Blocked Country
If you've been redirected to this page, then I believe visits from your country
to a certain part of my site to carry an unduly high risk. This is not intended
to discriminate against you for your ethnicity, origin, or beliefs.

### Why?
Because it's an unfortunate fact that your country has a high ratio of
bad-faith actors to normal, legitimate users when it comes to certain kinds of
content. I believe that humanity is only as free as its access to information
and literature, so I hate to 451 you if you're just here to read, but I can't
ignore the concerns I have of spam, botting, propaganda, et cetera.
