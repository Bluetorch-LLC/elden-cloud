## Elden Cloud - Blocked Country
If you've been redirected to this page, you're visiting from a country believed
to be problematic. Either that, or geolocation has failed for one reason or
another. This block isn't meant to be discriminatory on the basis of anyone's
ethnicity, beliefs, or origin. It is simply an observable, unfortunate fact
that certain countries are havens for bad actors.

You are welcome to read the content from the `md` directory of the

### Blocked Countries
- Israel
- India

This list is subject to growth.

### Israeli Visitors
If you're Israeli, there is a very high chance you support all of the
atrocities your government commits. Per a poll by Penn State University, almost
all of you support the forced removal of Palestinians from their land, and
nearly half of you support outright killing them all. Also known as "ethnic
cleansing" and "genocide." So I actually *am* discriminating against you for
your beliefs. Because yours are actually sick, twisted, inhuman, and almost
cartoonishly evil.
