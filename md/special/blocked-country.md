## Elden Cloud - Blocked Country
If you've been redirected to this page, you're visiting from a country believed
to be problematic. Either that, or geolocation has failed for one reason or
another. This block isn't meant to be discriminatory on the basis of anyone's
ethnicity, beliefs, or origin. It's an unfortunate spam prevention measure.

### Blocked Countries
- Israel
- India

This list is subject to growth.

### Israeli Visitors
If you're Israeli, there is a very high chance that I actually *am*
discriminating against you for your beliefs, because they are fucking twisted
and inhuman. Per a poll by Penn State University, almost all of you support the
forced removal of Palestinians from their homes, and nearly half of you support
outright killing them all. Also known as "ethnic cleansing" and "genocide" to
the civilized world that you assholes clearly departed from. I don't want you
on my website. Fuck off and close the tab.
