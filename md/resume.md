## Elden Cloud - Resume
If you're here, I probably sent you a job application, or you have some other
reason to see my resume. Linked below is an encrypted PDF that whatever
software you use should open just fine and prompt for a password. I should have
given you the password in my application or other communications we've had; if
not, you can [email me](mailto:jesse@elden.cloud) for it.

I do this because I do not want a document with my personal info, skillset, and
work history to be scraped by AI. At best that data will be used for invasive
marketing; anywhere else it ends up is probably illegal.
