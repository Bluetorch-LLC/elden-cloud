## Elden Journal - (2025.06.24) Bullshit Jobs, Bullshit Software
David Graeber's "Bullshit Jobs" theory, from his 2018 book of the same name,
posits that most of the jobs we make for ourselves are fake and psychologically
harmful in a society that ties one's self-worth to work output.

He defines a "real job" as one whose function can be described in three words
or less.

| Job | Description | Real? |
| --- | ----------- | ----- |
| Janitor | "I *clean the place*" | ‚úÖ |
| Fisherman | "I *catch fish*" | ‚úÖ |
| Farmer | "I *grow food*" | ‚úÖ |
| Mechanic | "I *repair engines*" | ‚úÖ |
| Doctor | "I *treat patients*" | ‚úÖ |
| Lawyer | "I *provide legal counsel*" | ‚úÖ |
| Teacher | "I *educate children*" | ‚úÖ |
| Middle Manager | "I *oversee the something-department at office 158 of SomeCorp and micromanage everyone's piss breaks*" | ‚ùå |
| Tech Bro Startup CEO | "I *apply blockchain and AI to modernize and synergize blah blah blah*" | ü§° |

This is not an exhaustive list, but you should get the idea.

### Bullshit Software
20 years ago, there weren't a billion frameworks and glue layers for you to use
everything, everywhere, all at once. If you wanted to write a program, you
learned an appropriate language and toolkit, like C# and Winforms for
high-level Windows stuff. If you wanted to make a webpage, you sat down with
your editor and you wrote HTML and CSS by hand. You either supported a couple
common aspect ratios or made the safe assumption of viewing on a 4:3 CRT. If
you wanted to build an API or what people would consider a webapp now, you used
PHP or CGI scripts, or ASP.NET if you hated yourself. If you wanted rich
content, you wrote it in Flash (okay, Flash deserved a fiery death). JavaScript
was seen basically nowhere but the browser. The only place it was really
acceptable to force-feed a shitload of either to the user was MySpace, and that
was because it all had a purpose; it was personal, stuff you wanted to show the
world on your own corner of the internet, and at the time being able to embed
a whole fucking game (or 20) on your little page was like, future tech.

Buckminster Fuller once said, "We have inspectors of inspectors and people
making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors." And that holds true
for modern software. We have huge frameworks for other frameworks, and
libraries for test suites to make sure the frameworks work together.

Not to mention we've appropriated the last 20 years of technological
advancements to allow developers to throw all their eggs in one basket and
kludge that shit everywhere. Your 16-core CPU running at 5GHz and 64GB of RAM
is for running Electron apps. Your GPU is for running unwanted AI features. And
your phone has 8-12GB of RAM now (or even more) so big companies can reuse
their webdevs as mobile devs and bundle a 500MB JavaScript framework with their
8000 dependencies. iOS apps used to be *much* smaller and leaner, too, before
Apple also started allowing that shit on their store. Now you can experience
the lagfest of 2012 Android an iPhone 15 Pro.

Anyway, this morning, I saw a post from "nixCraft" on Facebook that prompted me
to write this article. A post about the release of Motia, a "modern, unified
backend framework for APIs, events, and agents." What the *fuck?* It apparently
lets developers kludge *every* framework together. We've gone too far now.

So, I think it's time we apply Grueber's theory to software. If a program's
function can't be described in three words or less, fuck you, it's not real.

| Program | Description | Real? |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| ssh | opens remote shells | ‚úÖ |
| Sublime Text | edits text | ‚úÖ |
| Safari | displays webpages | ‚úÖ |
| Motia | merges everything that does everything into one great big clusterfuck | ü§° |
