## Elden Journal - (2025.06.22) Best and Worst Linux Desktop Environments
In 2010, when I started using Linux, it had a million options for desktop
environments and window managers. There were a million offshoot distros for
every conceivable setup. And most of them sucked ass and/or had no reason to
exist.

In 2025, Linux still has a million options, and a million offshoot distros with
no legitimate reason to exist. And most of them suck ass. I'm not covering all
the weird and bespoke options out there, mostly the DEs you'll find in a
mainstream distro's repositories.

### KDE Plasma
**Pros:** full Wayland support, no missing features, plenty of themes</br>
**Cons:** not for toaster PCs </br>
**Rating:** 9.5/10

A decade ago, KDE was pretty but a little buggy. Now it's pretty and fully
functional. Since Plasma 5 it's been pretty much perfect out of the box; a
premium-looking blend of Apple's frosted-flat look and the familiar start
menu/taskbar layout; but you *can* switch it up however you want, and there are
plenty of nice themes, window decorations, etc easily accessible from its
included KDE store frontends. Just make sure you find the matching GTK theme to
go with it so everything is consistent.

Valve ships it on Steam Decks for a reason. Or probably dozens. Whatever, the
point is that KDE is great and I stan for it here.

### Sway/i3
**Pros:** extremely lightweight, minimalist, Wayland support (sway)</br>
**Cons:** not user-friendly at first </br>
**Rating:** 8.5/10

Sway, and its older Xorg-based cousin i3, are very fast and very light tiling
window managers, and share the same config syntax. They're not for everyone and
they do absolutely no hand-holding. But if you're willing to do a fair amount
of reading, and configure some things by hand, you can have a *very* intuitive,
personalized workspace that hardly requires you to reach for your mouse, and
uses next to no resources for itself.

Neither really pull a lot of dependencies besides X/Wayland themselves, so you
have the choice of preferring either GTK or Qt-based apps if you're trying to
keep your installation small. I personally go with GTK when I go this route.

### MATE
**Pros:** lightweight, user-friendly, supports Wayland </br>
**Cons:** feels a little dated </br>
**Rating:** 8/10

MATE is a solid, conservative choice, whether your PC isn't bougie enough for
KDE or you want to maximize available resources on a more powerful machine. Or
maybe you just prefer GTK. It's basically Gnome 2 kept fresh in the modern age,
and it supports Wayland.

### Cinnamon
**Pros:** user-friendly, configurable, relatively lightweight </br>
**Cons:** no Wayland, can tax weak machines </br>
**Rating:** 7/10

Linux Mint's crown jewel isn't half bad; imagine if KDE were made with GTK. It
has all the niceties you'd expect if you were coming from Windows.

### LXQt
**Pros:** same as LXDE below, plus some support for Wayland </br>
**Cons:** I actually can't think of any major complaints </br>
**Rating:** 5/10

Imagine KDE, but its devs are all stuck with Intel Atom netbooks from 2010. You
would get LXQt. It's like a nicer cousin of LXDE, and as made obvious by the
name, it uses Qt instead of GTK.

### XFCE
**Pros:** lightweight, themeable, configurable </br>
**Cons:** feels and looks dated </br>
**Rating:** 4/10

If you have a shit PC, XFCE will be relatively nice to it. You can get it to
look decent with a little effort and it won't eat all of your RAM. And it's not
*completely* bare bones, it just feels...old. I would compare it to using
Windows Vista.

### LXDE
**Pros:** lightweight, minimalist </br>
**Cons:** Y2K feel </br>
**Rating:** 3.5/10

If you have a really, *really* shit PC that's old enough to drive a car, LXDE
might be your last option before resorting to text-based programs on a TTY. You
*can* theme it, and get it to look decent. But it feels like a fossil no matter
what you do. Openbox is really bare bones shit. You will feel like you're using
Windows 2000 with none of the fun stuff; I highly doubt you're doing any gaming
through Steam/Proton if you're resorting to LXDE.

### Gnome
**Pros:** supports Wayland I guess </br>
**Cons:** absurd VRAM usage, broken themes, intentionally missing features </br>
**Rating:** fucking garbage/10

Gnome is cool for about ten minutes, both the first time you use it, and every
time you try it again after a few years. But then you realize that it still
sucks, and is awkward as *fuck* to use. Seriously, what are they even going for
here? It's like a bastard child of macOS and Android, that tries to be both a
productive desktop and a touch-friendly interface, and fucking sucks at both.
They somehow took the concept of Windows 8, and made it both more awkward and
so much more wasteful.

And then there's the fact that it's just so fucking *broken* because, despite
its seeming popularity and default status on some of the largest distros, its
ecosystem is rotting. A lot of very nice and frequently-updated themes simply
do not support Gnome, and a lot of the extensions for it are bugged or outright
broken; I guess it changes so fast that people gave up on it.

Wanna theme it? Have fun finding one that still works, plus a matching shell
theme that also still works. Do you have tons of VRAM for your heaviest games?
Not anymore you don't. Accidentally closed your Steam or Discord window? Well,
the antiuser neckbeard devs don't believe in tray icons and they also broke the
extensions that put them back, so you can go fuck yourself. Why even bother?
