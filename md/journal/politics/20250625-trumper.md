## Elden Journal - (2025.06.25) Local Men Actually Hoped Trump Would Bomb Iran All Along
Earlier today, I found myself confused. Trump ran on a platform of "America
First" and "no wars," yet here we are bombing the Middle East again. So I
decided to ask a few local Trump fans for their thoughts.

### Luke, 35, Catalytic Coverter Connoisseur
To start, I decided to go to the main attraction of my little town, and only
grocery store for 15 miles: the Dollar General. I didn't spend long at all
wandering the lot before I came across Luke, looking under some guy's Denali
with a reciprocating saw in his hand. He brandished a 9mm Hi-Point and told me
to go fuck myself at first, but I offered him $8 worth of copper wire and a
roach as a gesture of goodwill and he agreed to an interview.

>**Elden Journal:** Thanks for talking to me today, Luke. So, how do you feel
about the bombing of Iran? </br>
**Luke:** Fuck em. I never liked em anyway. </br>
**EJ:** Okay, but, doesn't he need to go through Congress? The president can't
just decide to enter us into a conflict. </br>
**Luke:** Nah, Trump don't need to ask them for shit. He's the president. </br>
**EJ:** But...he literally does..? </br>
**Luke:** Where's it say that? </br>
**EJ:** The Constitution of the United States. Article 1, section 8. </br>
**Luke:** Oh, well fuck that shit then. </br>
**EJ:** But...never mind. *sigh*  How about this. War is expensive, isn't Trump
supposed to cut waste and shrink the deficit? </br>
**Luke:** The fuck's a deficit, man? </br>

### Wilson, 52, Landlord
With that unpleasant interview over, I took myself down by one of the many
local marinas to sit by the water and think. And there I met Wilson, having
just moored his 42-foot fishing yacht named the *Rent Increase.* He was more
than happy to talk to someone, anyone, about #47.

>**EJ:** Thank you for talking with me, Wilson. I'm trying to understand why
Trump's fans are okay with a new war all of a sudden. </br>
**Wilson:** Oh, it ain't like that, son. I've been hoping for this since the
beginning. </br>
**EJ:** But what do we even stand to gain from this? It's not our war. </br>
**Wilson:** Every war is America's war, son. Trump said he'd make us great
again, and part of that remindin' everyone who the swingin' dick of NATO is. </br>
**EJ:** I dunno man, that kinda sounds more like lining Lockheed Martin's
pockets and getting thousands of young men killed in another sand pit. </br>
**Wilson:** That's the point! I can't get it up for my wife anymore unless I'm
thinking about war. The flag-covered coffins. The crying mothers. The Hellfire
missiles. The destruction....oh God... </br>
**EJ:** I'm...gonna go now.

### Holden, 76, Vietnam Vet and Retired Pastor
I promptly left the lake after that conversation, now rather unsettled, and
decided to head home. On the way I spotted Mr. Bloodfeast outside of his house,
not far from where I live, pouring used motor oil into the ground to "give the
dinosaurs back to God." I figured, what the hell, what do I have to lose from
one more?

>**EJ:** Thanks, Mr. Bloodfeast. So, why do you support war on Israel's behalf? </br>
**Holden:** Simple. The Israelites is God's chosen people. </br>
**EJ:** But...most Israelis are from like, New York and shit.
**Wilson:** Yeah, but they got that Jesus blood in them! We gotta protect our
brothers in faith!
**EJ:** But they *killed* Jesus. And this could boil into World War 3.
**Holden:** Yes! And that could be the second coming of Christ!
**EJ:** You...*want* the world to end?
**Wilson:** I pray to God every night that I get to smell burning flesh again,
just once, before I depart this earth.
**EJ:** ...what?
**Holden:** Ah...I could die peacefully knowing that my little grandkids get to
live through all the horrors of Revelations...

I promptly drove myself to the gas station and purchased their remaining stock
of MD 20/20. There are AA meetings in my future.
