I consider myself a socially-moderate leftist. And these are my opinions. I am
just some guy on the internet, and mine are just as meaningless as yours in
this corporatist sheep farm of a country, but we all like to voice them anyway
don't we? If you're the type to become deeply and personally offended by the
opinions of some guy that differ from yours, red or blue, read at your own
peril.
