## <u>Elden Cloud - Zenkora's Domain</u>
The personal internet hidey-hole of a 30-year-old Okie. I'm Jesse (aka\*
zenkora). I like guns, fishing and (obviously) tech, and I'm just as at-home
with a Mac as I am an Arch box with i3wm, a legacy machine loaded with Windows
98, or a spare toaster running Haiku. Maybe you will find something here useful
or entertaining.
</br><sup>\*I am known by my handle to maybe five people lmao.</sup>

Personal sites and blogs are all but dead, but yet this one persists in the
year ~~2018~~ ~~2019~~ ~~2020~~ ~~2021~~ ~~2022~~ ~~2023~~ ~~2024~~ 2025. It's
moved across domains, servers, and states, been accidentally destroyed and
remade a couple times, but I still hold onto the delusion that people are
actually clicking a link somewhere, ending up on my site, and reading my drivel
or using something I made. Intentionally even. Crazy thought, isn't it?
