## <u>Elden Cloud - Main Page</u>
The personal internet hidey-hole of a 30-year-old Okie.

Personal sites and blogs are all but dead, yet this one persists in 2025. It's
moved across domains, servers, and states, been accidentally destroyed and
remade a couple times, but I still hold onto the delusion that people are
actually clicking a link somewhere, ending up on my site, and reading my drivel
or using something I made. Intentionally even. Crazy thought, isn't it?

### About Me
I'm Jesse (aka\* zenkora). I like guns, fishing and (obviously) tech, and I'm
just as at-home with a Mac as I am an Arch box with i3wm, a legacy machine
loaded with Windows 98, or a spare toaster running Haiku. Maybe you will find
something here useful or entertaining.
</br><sup>\*I am known by my handle to maybe five people lmao.</sup>

### About The Site
I wanted to run my own website since I was, like, 10. And once I had adult
money and a debit card I could do just that. I've owned a handful of domains
before, but this one (elden.cloud) is the first one cool enough to renew.
Because I love Elden Ring.

The pages you're loading are basically just templates, the actual content is
written in Markdown and pulled/translated on page load. So in a sense this site
is like, 40% of a CMS, but it all works client-side and looks/acts exactly the
way I want. No infinite autoscrolling bullshit, no attention grabbing, just
words and pictures on a clean background. The antithesis of the modern
web. And this design is simple enough that any non-coding individual with
moderate Google-fu could steal and adapt it.

Proudly not mobile-friendly. Idgaf if I don't get a high Google ranking.
