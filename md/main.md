## <u>Elden Cloud - Main Page</u>
The personal internet hidey-hole of a 30-year-old Okie.

Personal sites and blogs are all but dead, yet this one persists in 2025. It's
moved across domains, servers, and states, been accidentally destroyed and
remade a couple times, but I still hold onto the delusion that people are
actually clicking a link somewhere, ending up on my site, and reading my drivel
or using something I made. Intentionally even. Crazy thought, isn't it?

### About Me
I'm Jesse (aka\* zenkora). I like guns, fishing and (obviously) tech, and I'm
just as at-home with a Mac as I am an Arch box with i3wm, a legacy machine
loaded with Windows 98, or a spare toaster running Haiku. Maybe you will find
something here useful or entertaining.
</br><sup>\*I am known by my handle to maybe five people lmao.</sup>

### About The Site
Every page is a stub that loads content written in markdown and uses
showdown.js to translate it. Previous implementations were basically an SPA but
that made it impossible to link to specific pages, so 90% of the JavaScript
went away and every page got its own stub. I'm not a webdev, but I value
simplicity and this is it. Feel free to take my JS snippet and CSS.

Proudly not mobile-friendly. Idgaf if I don't get ranked high on Google.
